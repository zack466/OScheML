# primitive expressions + means of combination + means of abstraction
# code as data?

# comments as primitives? or fully-featured objects

commentlisp
- inspired by lisp?

# what if ... human-powered programming language (like mechanical turk lol)

annotate functions with comments? or pass comments as arguments

let x = 2;

int square(x); // a function that returns the square of the input

make optimizations to reduce amount of work humans have to do

print("Hello, world!");

(define (square x) (* the square of x *))

(define (compose f g) (lambda (x) (f (g x))))

(define pow4 (compose square square))

open-source interpreter, powered by the community
the first human-powered programming language
after all, aren't comments for humans to read?

don't know how to implement an algorithm? just add a comment, someone else will do it

what makes this different from copilot?

separate primitive operations into different "difficulties"
1st grade - basic math, addition, subtraction
12th grade - take the derivative of a function

define schemas for human cpus to fill in
web app front-end (is program back-end lmao)

queue of operations, everything async
like algebraic effects huh

humanlisp

essentiallly, comments are just another type of primitive, but must be async evaluated
essentially lazy evaluation
delay/force, comment/evaluate
